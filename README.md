# DesktopToolShortcutRemapper

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos](https://neos.com/) that remaps any keys on desktop from-to.

Relevant Neos issue: [#2412](https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/2412).

This is currently configurable.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [DesktopToolShortcutRemapper.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosDesktopToolShortcutRemapper/releases/latest/download/NeosDesktopToolShortcutRemapper.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
